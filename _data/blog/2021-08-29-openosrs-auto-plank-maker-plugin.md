Down the track, I will be making an *Ironman Construction Guide*, as well as a mobile calculator similar to my Agility one. Once they are out, the cards will show up on the screen for you to go to them.

Planks

When you are training Construction, you will always get the *same amount of XP per type of Plank you use*. There are a few exceptions, which I will talk about at the end of the article. But, right now, I am showing you guys the current *GP / XP for each Plank*, and how much XP each gives. Oaks have always been the cheapest, and will always be cheaper, due to their lower cost at the Sawmill. These numbers are likely to change very quickly. So, I have linked a few calculators down at the end of this article.

![openosrs plugins openosrs plugins](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_00de25b1e31449d7ba5947e5fc9bb11a~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_416,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_00de25b1e31449d7ba5947e5fc9bb11a~mv2.webp "openosrs plugins runelite plugins")

To start training your Construction, you can go to *any estate agent in Runescape.* A lot of the major cities around the game have an estate agent, and that first house will be in Rimmington, which is a great are to train your Construction at a low level.

Butlers

Before I get into the methods to 99, you should be aware of *Butlers*, which take your items from the bank to you. When you unlock to regular Butler, *I really recommend heading to Ardougne and getting him*. But, keep in mind, you need 2 Bedrooms in your house in order to hire a Butler. Butlers really *increase your Construction XP per hour*, and despite them costing some money, it is worth using them. Before you unlock the Butlers, the best way to train your Construction is at Rimmington by noting your Planks at Phials.

Then, when you run back to the portal, you can right click and enter straight into building mode.

Starting Off

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_9b3f3fcf30ce41b5a46dcb8eae6e3f84~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_141,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_9b3f3fcf30ce41b5a46dcb8eae6e3f84~mv2.webp)

To begin training your Construction *you will need firstly a Saw, a Hammer, 400 Steel Nails, 166 Regular Planks, and 452 Oak Planks*. This will get you all the way to level 33 Construction. That is going to cost you in total about 180 000.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_db680ab6922e4b9f96e9b6a76552c9e0~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_415,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_db680ab6922e4b9f96e9b6a76552c9e0~mv2.webp)

Cheaper Methods

There are ways to train your Construction for free through things like Limestone. But, you are far better off making money through Slayer or Bossing and then spending the money on Faster Construction XP.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_73f690b639ac497a853f8239b647cc04~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_414,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_73f690b639ac497a853f8239b647cc04~mv2.webp)

3 Routes

From here, I have *3 different pathways* for you to train your Construction, as well as the fastest XP method in the game, which I do not think many other guides have ever shown.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_3fe1a8b1621c4a6287ec8f826f644c34~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_180,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_3fe1a8b1621c4a6287ec8f826f644c34~mv2.webp)

Cheapest Methods

Level 33 – 47: Oak Larders

Firstly, I would like to start with the *cheapest* but *decently fast* way to get to level 99. From 33 – 47, you need to make *Oak Larders*. It will cost about 400 000.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_ac3dac57fa804ed3b3dc812b993bd87b~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_414,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_ac3dac57fa804ed3b3dc812b993bd87b~mv2.webp)

Level 47 – 99: Mounted Mythical Capes

From level 47 – 99, the best cheap and fast way to 99 Construction is *Mounted Mythical Capes.* This requires *Dragon Slayer 2*, and the reason why it is so much cheaper than any other method is because *you actually get more XP per Plank.* Since you are adding a Mythical Cape, the game gives you more XP.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_d92b167f91284f2396274e8916b7b7d1~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_414,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_d92b167f91284f2396274e8916b7b7d1~mv2.webp)

But, *when you remove the Mounted Mythical Cape off the wall, you get the Cape back.* In total, you will need about 105 000 Teak Planks, which will cost about 94 000 000 getting to 99. The average XP rate is 265 000 – 270 00, and if you do the math, getting to 99 from 47 is going to take you *approximately 50 hours*. If you have not done Dragon Slayer 2, then there is another pretty cheap alternative.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_f0f656863100489b8225633874cd7683~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_416,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_f0f656863100489b8225633874cd7683~mv2.webp)

Level 47 – 74: Oak Larders

Continue making *Oak Larders* from level 47 all the way through to 74 Construction. That is going to cost about 7 500 000.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_482eda23626747abbe5faa7da64380cb~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_416,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_482eda23626747abbe5faa7da64380cb~mv2.webp)

Level 74 – 99: Oak Dungeon Doors

Then at level 74, you will unlock *Oak Dungeon Doors,* which you should do all the way through to 99. On average, people get about 410 000 – 420 000 XP per hour here. But, if you are really efficient and you are always holding down 1, you can get up to about 480 000 XP per hour. You need 199 000 Oak Planks to get to 99 Construction from level 74. But, it will cost you about 10 000 000 more than doing Mounted Mythical Capes. The *XP rates are a little bit faster* for Oak Dungeon Doors. It is really up to you.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_6978eaf1370d4f628952b78fc0306c68~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_414,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_6978eaf1370d4f628952b78fc0306c68~mv2.webp)

Fastest Methods

So, those are the cheap and decently quick ways to 99 Construction. But, now for the *more expensive but much faster ways*.

Level 33 – 52: Oak Larders

So, going all the way back to level 33, from 33 – 52, the fastest way is doing *Oak Larders*, which will cost about 800 000.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_b3547fe6b260482db3225f854ff4ab1b~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_414,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_b3547fe6b260482db3225f854ff4ab1b~mv2.webp)

Level 52 – 99: Mahogany Tables

From 52 – 99, one of the fastest methods in the game is *Mahogany Tables*. But, there is actually one that is a bit faster than Mahogany Tables that I will show in a second. With a *Demon Butler* and very precise clicks, you can get over 600 000 XP per hour when you are making these. That means that it *only takes about 20 hours* to get from level 52 – 99 Construction, which is under 1 day.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_8b7b0826dba848e6bff63b096027852a~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_414,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_8b7b0826dba848e6bff63b096027852a~mv2.webp)

Level 77 – 99: Mahogany Benches

While that has been the traditional fastest Construction method, there is a faster way that I showed in a video recently with *Mahogany Benches,* unlocked at level 77. It *costs exactly the same as Mahogany Tables*. But, it is a lot more click intensive and requires a lot more focus. You can get over 900 000 XP per hour, and up to 1 000 000 XP per hour with these Mahogany Benches. So, that means that with room for error, it will take *only 13 hours* to get from level 77 – 99 Construction. So, that is the fastest and pretty expensive way to 99 Construction.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_8b43345eaa0747c6b5fbc4bd45c76ce0~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_415,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_8b43345eaa0747c6b5fbc4bd45c76ce0~mv2.webp)

Alternative Method: Level 66 – 99: Teak Benches

Now, the last method that I want to talk about is one that is sort of in the middle. At level 66 Construction, you unlock *Teak Benches*, and you can do the same method that I showed with the Mahogany Benches, and you can get upwards of 700 000 XP per hour with perfect clicks. Normally, you will get about 500 000 – 600 000 XP per hour. But, this method is *a lot cheaper* than doing Mahogany Tables and Mahogany Benches, and will only cost you about 125 000 000.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_688af1059b63400cac7f0fb894928bbc~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_415,al_c,lg_1,q_95/a27d24_688af1059b63400cac7f0fb894928bbc~mv2.webp)

Summary

So, I would like to do a recap of all of the methods so you guys can see how they all compare and which one you should pick. So, from level 1 – 33, you are working with *Planks* and *Oak Planks*, and then you can do *Oak Larders*, then *Mythical Capes to 99*, which will cost about 95 000 000. Or, alternatively, you can do *Oak Larders* and *Oak Dungeon Doors to 99*, which will cost about 104 000 000. Or, the fastest method with *Oak Larders*, then *Mahogany Tables*, and then *Mahogany Benches*, costing a total of 193 000 000. Or, you can do the method with *Teak Benches,* unlocked at level 66, costing a total of 125 000 000. If you have a lot of money, then it is probably worth going ahead with the Mahogany Benches. Or, to save some money, you can stick to Oak or do Mounted Mythical Capes.
